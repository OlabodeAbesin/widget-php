### Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)

## Getting Started

Clone this project with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahbaz17/php-rest-api.git
cd php-rest-api
```
## Assumptions
- I assumed this is a small test app so I didn't connect to storage system
- As above, I implemented the system as a REST API, as against a command-line (Since Symfony framework is not allowed.

## Development

Clone the project dependencies and start the PHP server as below:

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t api
```
